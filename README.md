# Vocabulary.com-scraper
An android app which scraps the definitions of the words from Vocabulary.com 

An app which I developed to help me prepare for GRE

It scrapped the defination of a word from Vocabulary.com webpage, as they had very easy to remeber definitions, and store 
them on a local database.

It also had a featue, which loaded a random word and its definition from a list of high frequency GRE words.
